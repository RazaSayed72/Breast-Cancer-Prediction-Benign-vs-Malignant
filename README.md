# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Benign-vs-Malignant
This project predicts whether breast cancer is benign or malignant using machine learning. Features like radius, texture, perimeter, and concavity from fine needle aspirate (FNA) images are analyzed to build a classification model for early and accurate cancer diagnosis.
